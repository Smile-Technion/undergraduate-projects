One diamentional Impedance behavior simulation of a mass-spring-damper element.
Based on the paper: Accuracy/Robustness Dilemma in Impedance Control by Valency and Zacksenhouse (2003)
Simulation is based on lines [7] and [8] in the paper -'DB-IC' control law.

contact force with a stationary element is being simulated by exerting exponential forces on the mass-spring-damper element.

For this simulation we used Matlab version -2020a with simscape multibody package.
If you want to run this simulation with previous version of matlab please contact us by email.
